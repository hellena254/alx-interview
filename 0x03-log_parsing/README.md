# Log Parsing Project

## Description
This project involves parsing log entries from standard input, computing metrics, and printing statistics. The script reads input line by line, processes valid log entries, and maintains a count of different HTTP status codes and the total file size. Statistics are printed after every 10 lines and upon keyboard interruption (CTRL + C).

## Requirements
- Python 3.4.3
- PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.x)

## Files
- `0-stats.py`: The main script that reads log entries, processes them, and prints statistics.
- `0-generator.py`: A script to generate log entries for testing purposes.

## Usage
1. **Make the scripts executable:**
    ```sh
    chmod +x 0-stats.py
    chmod +x 0-generator.py
    ```

2. **Run the generator script and pipe its output to the statistics script:**
    ```sh
    ./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py
    ```

3. **Interrupt the statistics script with CTRL + C to print final statistics.**

## Example
### Input
Log entries generated by `0-generator.py`:

192.168.1.1 - [10/Jul/2024:22:14:15 +0000] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" 200 512
192.168.1.2 - [10/Jul/2024:22:14:16 +0000] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" 404 1024


### Output
Statistics printed by `0-stats.py` after every 10 lines and upon keyboard interruption:

File size: 1536
200: 1
404: 1

File size: 3072
200: 2
404: 2
...

File size: 5120
200: 4
404: 4
